## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using **React 18** with **Vite** as the build tool, providing fast development and optimized production builds. The application uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, creating a modern dark-mode aesthetic that's both professional and visually appealing.

**State Management** is handled by **Zustand**, a lightweight state management library that provides better performance than Redux while maintaining simplicity. This choice demonstrates understanding of modern React patterns and efficient state management.

**Routing** is implemented using **React Router DOM**, providing seamless navigation between different sections of the application with protected routes for authenticated users.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, showcasing server-side JavaScript development. The application uses **MongoDB** with **Mongoose ODM** for data persistence, demonstrating NoSQL database management and schema design.

**Authentication** is implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** with **bcryptjs** for password hashing, following industry security standards. This approach ensures secure user sessions without server-side session storage.

### Integration Strategy
The frontend and backend communicate through a **RESTful API** architecture, with the frontend using **Axios** for HTTP requests. A **Vite proxy configuration** enables seamless development by forwarding API requests from the frontend to the backend server.

## üîß Technical Implementation Highlights

### State Management Architecture
The application uses **Zustand** for state management, implementing a centralized store that manages authentication state, market data, portfolio information, and transaction history. The store includes computed values and async actions, demonstrating advanced state management patterns.

### API Design Patterns
The backend implements **RESTful API design** with proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and response formatting. The API includes middleware for authentication, request validation, and error handling, following industry best practices.

### Database Design
The MongoDB database uses a **normalized schema design** with separate collections for users and transactions. The transaction model includes proper relationships and indexing for efficient querying and data integrity.

### Security Implementation
Security measures include **password hashing** with bcrypt, **JWT token authentication**, **CORS configuration**, and **input validation**. The application follows OWASP security guidelines and implements proper error handling to prevent information disclosure.

## üìä Data Flow & Integration

### Authentication Flow
The authentication system implements a secure flow where users register or login, receive JWT tokens, and use these tokens for subsequent API requests. The frontend automatically handles token storage and includes interceptors for automatic token attachment and refresh.

### Trading Workflow
The trading system follows a complete workflow from market data fetching to transaction execution and portfolio updates. Users can view current market prices, execute trades, and immediately see updated portfolio values and transaction history.

### Real-Time Updates
The application implements automatic data synchronization between frontend and backend, ensuring users always see current information. Portfolio values update automatically after trades, and market data refreshes to provide current pricing information.
